1) Method 1 yields a greater number of comparisons. The first method is order
of n and the second method is order of n.
2) Method 2 will always yield a correct answer since the goal is to get each
row into increasing order and each column into increasing order. Since we sort
each row first each the end of each row contains the greatest value in the row
and the first value contains the least value in the row. So if we sort the
greates values of each row (the last column) we get the greatest greatest value
in the bottom right and the least greatest value in the upper right.
