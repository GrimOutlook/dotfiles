# Disallow known nested repos. The format for each below essentially works out
# to ignore symlinks with a given name but allow everything else of the same
# name.
#
# TODO: Figure out if there is a better way to just ignore symlinks
# entirely as they should not be tracked in this repo. Maybe make a pre-commit
# hook that checks for symlinks and fails if one is found in the directory? That
# would likely just be an add on to this fix though.
