## Current Issues

### Windows Font Cache

Upon restart Windows Terminal can no longer find the custom font that I use
(JetBrainsMono NF). Need to add steps on how to fix this on every startup for
non-priviledged users as the main fix out there is to install for all users
which only admins have rights to.
